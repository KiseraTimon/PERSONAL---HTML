I'll practice the several concepts I've learn on HTML

<!--
    The code above shows how to use a button as a link.
    The button is created using the <button> element.
    The onclick attribute is used to specify a JavaScript code that will run when the button is clicked.
    In this case, the code will redirect the user to the W3Schools website.
    The window.location.href property is used to set the URL of the current window.
    By setting it to the URL of the W3Schools website, the user will be redirected to that site when the button is clicked.
    The button text is "Visit W3Schools.com".
    When the user clicks the button, they will be taken to the W3Schools website.
