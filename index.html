<!--
    The <a> tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.
    The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.
    By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:
    An unvisited link is underlined and blue
    A visited link is underlined and purple
    An active link is underlined and red
    You can change the default link colours by using CSS:
    <style>
    a:link {
    color: green;
    }
    a:visited {
    color: green;
    }
    a:hover {
    color: red;
    }
    a:active {
    color: yellow;
    }
    </style>
