<!--This is my first HTML document. On it,
I'll practice the several concepts I've learn on HTML
over the past few weeks-->


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph</p>
</body>
</html>

<!--I've included my first ever heading and paragraph
withing the body element.
I learn about HTML elements, the tags associated
and nested HTML elements (Elements within other elements)-->
