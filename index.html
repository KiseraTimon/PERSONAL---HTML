<!--This is my first HTML document. On it,
I'll practice the several concepts I've learn on HTML
over the past few weeks-->


<!DOCTYPE html>

<h1>Absolute & Relative URLs</h1>
<h2>Absolute URLs</h2>

<p>
    They specify the full web address
    <a href="https://www.cars.com/">Link to car website</a>
</p>
<hr>

<h2>Relative URLs</h2>
<p>They are local links (Link to a page within the website)<br>
    The URL does not have the <ins>https://www</ins> part<br>
    An example:<br>
    <a href="index.html">Relative URL to reload this page</a>
</p>

</body>
</html>

<!--
    The target attribute defines where a link is opened
    Its values can be:

    _self - Default. Link is opened on the same tab
    _blank - Opens link in a new tab
    _parent - Opens link on a parent frame
    _top - Opens in full body of the window
